## Getting Started

1. Install and configure the version of Node JS listed in the .nvmrc file
2. Configure `.env` files in the root `/` and `/supabase`
3. Run `npm start` to run the app locally
4. TODO: Local supabase setup

## Working with Supabase

- Currently there is only a production instance that is used for development
- Log into the supabase CLI with `deno task supabase:login`
- Pull types after db changes with `deno task supabase:types`
